Welcome to QuoteMe! This Privacy Policy describes how QuoteMe ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the QuoteMe mobile application ("App"). By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect

### Camera Access

QuoteMe requires access to your device's camera to enable the functionality of quoting a picture. We only access the camera when you actively use the App to capture images for quoting purposes. We do not store or transmit any images or videos captured by your camera.

### Quote Information

When you use the App to quote a picture, we collect and process the following information:

- **Quoted Picture**: The image you provide to create a quote. This image is used solely for the purpose of generating the quote and is not stored or shared with any third parties.

- **Generated Quote**: The quote generated based on the provided image. This quote may be stored temporarily within the App for display purposes but is not transmitted or shared with any third parties.

## Use of Information

QuoteMe uses the collected information for the following purposes:

- To generate quotes based on the images you provide using the App's functionality.

- To improve the App's features and performance through analysis of usage patterns and feedback.

- To provide a personalized user experience and enhance the functionality of the App.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

QuoteMe respects your privacy and will not sell, rent, or disclose your personal information or quoted pictures to third parties, except as described in this Privacy Policy or with your consent. We may share your information in the following circumstances:

- **Service Providers**: We may engage trusted third-party service providers to perform functions and services on our behalf, such as hosting, data analysis, and improvement of the App. These providers will have access to your information only to the extent necessary to perform their functions and are obligated to maintain its confidentiality.

- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to enforce our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

## Data Security

QuoteMe takes reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We implement industry-standard security practices and procedures to safeguard your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Data Retention

QuoteMe retains your information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or as required by law. Your quoted pictures and generated quotes are not stored or retained once they have been used within the App.
